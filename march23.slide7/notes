#From class mate Jamil:
#list1 = (10,20,0,40)
#sum_of_elements = sum(list1)
#len_of_list1 = len (list1)
#avg = sum_of_elements/len_of_list1
#print(avg)

#from CM William
#def GetAverage(myList):
#tempNum = 0

# for x in myList:
#tempNum += x
#return (tempNum / len(myList))

#myList = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
#print(GetAverage(myList))
